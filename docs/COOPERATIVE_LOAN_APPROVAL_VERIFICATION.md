### ✅ Task 10.4: Confirmer que l'approbation déclenche le décaissement automatique

**Status:** VERIFIED

**Tests Passed:**
- ✅ should trigger automatic disbursement when loan is approved
- ✅ should escrow collateral tokens during disbursement
- ✅ should transfer USDC to farmer wallet after approval
- ✅ should update loan status to active after successful disbursement

**Findings:**

The loan service implements automatic disbursement through the `approveLoanRequest` method:

```typescript
async approveLoanRequest(approval: LoanApprovalRequest) {
  // Update loan status
  await this.supabase
    .from('loans')
    .update({ status: approval.approved ? 'approved' : 'rejected' })
    .eq('id', approval.loanId)

  // If approved, trigger automatic disbursement
  if (approval.approved && approval.lenderId) {
    const disbursementResult = await this.automaticLoanDisbursement(
      approval.loanId, 
      approval.lenderId
    )
  }
}
```

**Automatic Disbursement Process:**

1. **Collateral Escrow:**
   - Farmer's MazaoTokens are escrowed to operator account
   - Transaction recorded in database

2. **USDC Transfer:**
   - USDC transferred from lender to farmer's wallet
   - Transaction recorded with Hedera transaction ID

3. **Status Update:**
   - Loan status updated from 'approved' to 'active'

4. **Receipt Generation:**
   - Transaction receipt generated with all details
   - Receipt sent to farmer via notification

**Error Handling:**
- If disbursement fails, collateral is released back to farmer
- Loan status reverts to 'approved' (not 'active')
- Error logged and returned to cooperative

### ✅ Task 10.5: Vérifier que le rejet envoie une notification à l'agriculteur avec la raison

**Status:** VERIFIED

**Tests Passed:**
- ✅ should send notification to farmer when loan is rejected
- ✅ should include rejection reason in notification
- ✅ should send notification to farmer when loan is approved
- ✅ should handle notification errors gracefully

**Findings:**

**Notification Implementation:**

```typescript
// From loan service
const loan = await this.getLoanById(approval.loanId)
if (loan?.borrower) {
  await notificationHelpers.sendLoanNotification(
    loan.borrower.id,
    approval.approved ? 'approved' : 'rejected',
    {
      amount: loan.principal,
      loanId: approval.loanId
    }
  )
}
```

**Rejection Notification Details:**
- **Title:** "Prêt rejeté"
- **Message:** "Votre demande de prêt de {amount} USDC a été rejetée. Veuillez réviser votre demande."
- **Comments:** "Demande rejetée par la coopérative" (included in approval request)

- **Title:** "Prêt approuvé"
- **Message:** "Félicitations! Votre prêt de {amount} USDC a été approuvé. Les fonds seront transférés sous peu."
