## Implementation Details

### Page Structure
```typescript
src/app/[lang]/dashboard/farmer/loans/page.tsx
├── Authentication check (useAuth)
├── Router setup (useRouter, useParams)
├── Page header
└── LoanDashboard component
    ├── Summary cards (total, active, borrowed, outstanding)
    ├── Actions card with "Nouvelle demande de prêt" button
    └── Loans list
        ├── Loan cards with status badges
        ├── Loan details (principal, collateral, interest, due date)
        ├── Disbursement status component
        └── Action buttons (Rembourser, Voir détails)
```

### Component Integration
- **LoanDashboard**: Main component managing loan display and navigation
- **LoanDetailsPage**: Detailed view with repayment interface
- **LoanRepaymentInterface**: Payment processing for active loans

3. Can click "Nouvelle demande de prêt" → redirects to `/[lang]/dashboard/farmer/loans/request`
4. Can click "Voir détails" on any loan → shows LoanDetailsPage
5. For active loans, can click "Rembourser" or "Effectuer un Remboursement" → shows LoanRepaymentInterface
