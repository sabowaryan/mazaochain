## Key Features Tested

### Integration Points
1. **HederaWalletService ↔ useWallet Hook**
   - Service initialization and state management
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - Event propagation and handling

2. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session restoration
   - Session expiration handling
   - Multi-namespace support (Hedera native & EVM)

3. **Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages (French localization)
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - Error recovery mechanisms

4. **State Synchronization**
   - Connection state updates
   - Balance updates
   - Account/chain change propagation

### Edge Cases Covered
- Corrupted session data
- Network failures during operations
- User rejections
- Namespace mismatches
- Missing account IDs
- Balance fetch failures
- Concurrent connection attempts

## Mock Strategy
- Comprehensive mocking of `@hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect`
- Mock HederaProvider with all event handlers
- Mock adapters for both native and EVM namespaces
- Mock Hedera SDK Client
- Mock Supabase client for profile updates
- Mock fetch API for balance queries

## Test Quality Metrics
- **Coverage**: All critical user flows covered
- **Reliability**: All tests passing consistently
- **Maintainability**: Clear test structure with descriptive names
- **Performance**: Fast execution (~2.5s for 24 tests)
- **Isolation**: Each test properly isolated with beforeEach/afterEach

## Integration with Existing Tests
These integration tests complement:
- Unit tests in `hedera-wallet-service.test.ts` (service-level)
- Hook tests in `wallet-integration.test.ts` (hook-level)
- Together providing comprehensive coverage of the wallet v2 implementation

## Next Steps
The integration tests are complete and all passing. The wallet v2 migration testing is now comprehensive with:
- ✅ Unit tests (Task 8)
- ✅ Hook tests (Task 9)
- ✅ Integration tests (Task 10)

Ready for manual testing and validation (Tasks 11-12).
