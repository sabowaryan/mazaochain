# Task 6 Completion Summary

**Task:** Auditer et corriger la configuration des smart contracts  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-01-07

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Variables Audit ✅
- Verified `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOAN_MANAGER_CONTRACT_ID` is properly configured (0.0.6913910)
- Verified `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAZAO_TOKEN_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` is properly configured (0.0.6913902)
- Updated `.env.local.example` to include contract address variables
- Updated `.env.production.example` with mainnet contract address placeholders
- All contract IDs follow the correct Hedera format (0.0.XXXXXX)

### 2. Contract ABIs Verification ✅
- Confirmed `contracts/compiled/LoanManager.json` exists and is up to date
- Confirmed `contracts/compiled/MazaoTokenFactory.json` exists and is up to date
- Verified all required functions are present in both ABIs:
  - **LoanManager:** createLoan, approveLoan, getLoan, repayLoan, liquidateCollateral, etc.
  - **MazaoTokenFactory:** createCropToken, mintTokens, burnTokens, getTokenDetails, etc.

### 3. useMazaoContracts Hook Verification ✅
- Verified all token operations are exposed:
  - createCropToken
  - mintTokens
  - getFarmerBalanceForToken
  - getFarmerTotalBalance
  - getTokenDetails
- Verified all loan operations are exposed:
  - requestLoan
  - getLoanDetails
- Verified utility functions:
  - getNextTokenId
  - getNextLoanId
- Verified complete workflows:
  - tokenizeEvaluation
- Verified state management (loading, error)

### 4. Error Handling Verification ✅
- All contract methods have proper try-catch blocks
- Consistent error response structure: `{ success: false, error: string }`
- Success response structure: `{ success: true, transactionId, data }`
- Errors are logged for debugging
- Hook provides additional error state management

### 5. Hedera Testnet Integration ✅
- Network: Hedera Testnet
- Account ID: 0.0.6913540
- Contracts deployed and accessible:
  - MazaoTokenFactory: 0.0.6913902
  - LoanManager: 0.0.6913910
- Client initialization uses lazy loading pattern

### 6. Configuration Updates ✅
- Updated `src/lib/contracts/deployed-contracts.ts` to use environment variables
- Made configuration dynamic based on env vars
- Added fallback values for development
- Maintained type safety with TypeScript

### 7. Test Suite Created ✅
- Created comprehensive test file: `src/__tests__/contracts/smart-contracts-config.test.ts`
- All 19 tests passing
- Test coverage includes:
  - Environment variables validation
  - Deployed contracts configuration
  - Hook interface verification
  - Error handling structure
  - ABI availability and functions

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `src/__tests__/contracts/smart-contracts-config.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
2. `SMART_CONTRACTS_CONFIG_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Detailed audit report
3. `TASK_6_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified
1. `.env.local.example` - Added contract address variables
2. `.env.production.example` - Added mainnet contract address placeholders
3. `src/lib/contracts/deployed-contracts.ts` - Made configuration dynamic

## Test Results

```
✓ Smart Contracts Configuration Audit (19 tests) 1199ms
  ✓ Environment Variables (4 tests)
  ✓ Deployed Contracts Configuration (3 tests)
  ✓ useMazaoContracts Hook Interface (6 tests)
  ✓ MazaoContractsService Error Handling (2 tests)
  ✓ Contract ABIs (4 tests)

Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  19 passed (19)
```

## Requirements Met

- ✅ **4.1** - Contract addresses are properly configured in .env files
- ✅ **4.2** - ABIs are up to date and accessible
- ✅ **4.3** - useMazaoContracts hook exposes all necessary functions
- ✅ **4.5** - Error handling is properly implemented

## Key Findings

1. **Contract Configuration:** All contract addresses are properly configured and follow Hedera format
2. **ABIs:** Both contract ABIs are complete and include all required functions
3. **Integration Layer:** The useMazaoContracts hook provides a clean, type-safe interface
4. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with consistent response structures
5. **Testing:** Full test coverage ensures configuration reliability

## Next Steps

The smart contract configuration is complete and verified. The system is ready for:
1. Testing contract interactions on Hedera Testnet
2. Proceeding to Task 7: Audit du système d'évaluation des cultures
3. Integration testing with the evaluation and loan workflows

## Notes

- All contract IDs are from the actual deployed contracts on Hedera Testnet
- The configuration supports both testnet and mainnet environments
- Error handling provides clear feedback for debugging
- The test suite can be run anytime to verify configuration integrity
