- Browser compatibility checklist
- Mobile compatibility checklist
- Summary section for results
- Issue tracking sections
- Sign-off section for approval

### 3. Testing Helper Script (`test-wallet-connection.js`)

A browser console script providing automated testing utilities:

**Available Functions**:
- `checkSession()` - Inspect current WalletConnect session
- `checkStorage()` - View all wallet-related storage
- `clearSession()` - Clear WalletConnect sessions
- `monitorEvents()` - Start monitoring wallet events
- `stopMonitoring()` - Stop event monitoring and view log
- `testConnectionSpeed()` - Measure connection performance
- `getTestReport()` - Generate comprehensive test report
- `healthCheck()` - Quick wallet health verification

**Features**:
- Automatic health check on load
- Event logging and monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Storage inspection
- Session validation
- Report generation

## How to Use These Testing Materials

### For Manual Testing:

1. **Start with the Manual Testing Guide**:
   ```
   Open: .kiro/specs/hashpack-wallet-v2-migration/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md
   ```
   - Follow each test sequentially
   - Record results in the provided spaces
   - Note any issues or observations

2. **Use the Testing Checklist for Quick Validation**:
   ```
   Open: .kiro/specs/hashpack-wallet-v2-migration/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
   ```
   - Print or use digitally
   - Check off completed tests
   - Track pass/fail status

3. **Load the Testing Helper Script**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   // 1. Copy contents of test-wallet-connection.js
   // 2. Paste into browser DevTools console
   // 3. Use helper functions during testing
   ```

### Testing Workflow:

## Testing Prerequisites

Before starting manual testing, ensure:

- [ ] HashPack Chrome extension installed (latest version)
- [ ] HashPack mobile app installed (for WalletConnect tests)
- [ ] Hedera testnet account with HBAR balance
- [ ] Application running locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Browser DevTools open
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` configured
- [ ] Network set to testnet

## Expected Testing Duration

- **Full Test Suite**: 2-3 hours
- **Quick Validation**: 30-45 minutes
- **Browser Compatibility**: 1-2 hours
- **Mobile Testing**: 1 hour

## Success Criteria

The manual testing phase is considered successful when:

1. ✅ All 19 core tests pass
2. ✅ No critical issues found
3. ✅ Performance metrics meet targets:
   - Connection time < 5 seconds
   - Balance fetch < 3 seconds
4. ✅ Browser compatibility confirmed (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave)
5. ✅ Mobile compatibility confirmed (if applicable)
6. ✅ Test report generated and reviewed
7. ✅ Sign-off obtained for production deployment

## Known Limitations

Since this is a manual testing task:

- Tests must be executed by a human tester
- Results depend on tester's environment and setup
- Some tests require specific HashPack configurations
- Mobile tests require physical devices or emulators
- Network conditions may affect performance metrics

## Next Steps

After completing manual testing:

1. **Review Results**:
   - Analyze test report
   - Identify any issues or patterns
   - Document findings

2. **Address Issues**:
   - Fix any critical bugs found
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Update documentation

3. **Re-test if Needed**:
   - Re-run failed tests after fixes
   - Validate bug fixes
   - Confirm improvements

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Obtain final sign-off
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues
